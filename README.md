# Minewrap
A set-and-forget minecraft server wrapper which enables scheduled restarts and backups of your server. It is meant to be kept as simple as possible yet robust.

### Usage
Setup the minewrap.properties file according to your system setup, run the provided scripts or run the jar file directly and you're done.
You can use the **test** command while the server is running to perform a on-demand backup. Use this to verify that the wrapper works properly.
