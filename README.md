# Minewrap
A set-and-forget minecraft server wrapper which enables scheduled restarts and backups of your server. It is meant to be kept as simple as possible yet robust.

### Usage
Setup the minewrap.properties file according to your system setup, run the provided scripts or run the jar file directly and you're done.
You can use the **test** command while the server is running to perform a backup on-demand. Use this to verify that the wrapper works properly.

### Planned features for version 1.0
* Integrated compression using zip/gzip.
* A few more options for customization, for example setting scheduling intervals manually.
* Logging to console and file and thus replacing writing directly to stdout.

**DISCLAIMER: This is still a work-in-progress application!**
